Store Student Grades:
A dictionary grades_dict is used to store student names as keys and their grades as a list.

Calculate Average Grade:
For each student, the average grade is calculated by summing their grades and dividing by the number of grades

Display Grades and Averages:
The program iterates through each student in the dictionary, printing the student's name, their grades, and the calculated average grade.
This simplified version keeps the functionality basic while still achieving the main goal of tracking and displaying student grades.
